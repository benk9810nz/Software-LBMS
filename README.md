# C# SQL Library Database Management System

This Repository contains the solution and files for my Library Database Management System that I created with 3 others in my Software Engineering Course

## Applications & Files
### SQL Database
As part of this system, we connected all of our application so a SQL Database. This database was responsible for the storing of all the information in our 
applications, such as the user logins and the Books, Book Copies etc.

As a group we decided on the tables and attributes within our database, which I then developed and created the SQL Database using a SQL Creation Script.

### Automatic Emails Applicaiton
This folder contains the solution and files for our Automatic Emails Applicaiton that we submitted in my Software Engineering Class.

As part of my role, I was fully responsible for the development and creation of the Automatic Emails Application.

Some of the proudest moments of my development of this application was incorporating and linking the application with an external service provider **Authy** and 
**MailKit** which allowed the application to send SMS and Email Messages to the Customers informing them of Reminder and Overdue Books.
 
### Self-Checkout Application
This folder contains the solution and files for our Self Checkout Applicaiton that we submitted in my Software Engineering Class.

As part of my role, I was fully responsible for the development and creation of the Self-Checkout Application.

This Application was created to allow the user to present their ID Card, and Books which would have an embedded RFID Tag within them. Due to how we were using
Phidgets (https://www.phidgets.com/) in our Human Computer Interaction class, we decided to incorporate the Phidget RFID Tag Reader to read these values. However,
the RFID-Tag values (which are stored in the database) can be manually input on the forms in the Text Box if a Phidget RFID Reader is not being used.

### Library Management Application
This folder contains the solution and files for our Library Management Applicaiton that we submitted in my Software Engineering Class.

This Application was designed to allow libarians and Customers to login and perform actions, such as searching for books, placing holds, updating information
and seeing the current details such as the current books on issue.

As part of my role within this group, I was a co-developer of this application. I helped to created alot of the backend code, such as the different SQL Statements
used within this application to retrieve information from the different tables in the SQL Database. I was also responsible for some of the content on the window forms, such
as the use of the ListViews to show infomration, use of Tabs to allow the user to access their information, and incorporating the Phidget RFID Tags within this application.

As part of this applciation development I worked with my fellow team-mate **Henry Sly** to create this application. Henry was the lead developer for this application, with me
creating alot of the back-end code.

### Documentation
As part of this assignment we have to submit a written Report explaining the different aspects and components of the application. Jointly the 3 of us in my team worked together to
create this document.
