Within this folder we have 2 SQL Scripts. 

One of these is the creation SQL Script that Ben created to create the MYSQL Database.

The other Script is a SQL Dump as of Friday 12th June 2020 which contains the structure and all of the data that is contained within the database.

These have been respectifully named "Creation Scrip.sql" and "Database_Dump.sql"

The Database_Dump.sql was extracted raw from SQLYog
