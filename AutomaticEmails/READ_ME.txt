This folder consists of our AutomaticEmails Applcation, which is a console C# Applcation created to automatically send emails and texts to people.

The AutomaticEmails EXE File in the Root directory of this folder is a shortcut to the application.

The Visual Studio RAW Files Folder contains the Visual Studio C# Solution for this application (the raw C# Files)

Because this is a console application, there is no interaction needed with the user, everything done is automatically through the Database.

For Testing/Deployment purposes we have added a Write Line ("Successfully done") and a Read Line allowing the tutor to see this message


Due to how I have opened this application to the internet, I have replaced the configuration strings with #### to protect the security of the fields.
